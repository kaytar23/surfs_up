- The difference between the average temperatures of each month is approximately 4 degrees
- The lowest temperature in December was 8 degrees colder than the lowest temperature in June
- The highest temperature in June is only 2 degrees warmer than the highest temperature in December

## Summary
  The temperature differences between the months of June and December show that the temperature stays fairly consistant throughout the year, therefore based on temperature alone, there is no reason not top be open year round. If you wanted to look at other data, you may want to analyse precipitation dat and/or other weather phenomena around the year.
